V1 - The very first design concept of the box. The issue with this was that we needed the top to be shorter than the bottom which was not the case in this iteration.

V2 Bottom - This was the second interation of just the bottom.

V2 Top - This was the second iteration of the top.

VF Bottom -  This was the final iteration of the bottom. The issue with this was that the print time was too long, so we had to reduce the thicknesses of some of the walls.

VF Top - This was the final iteration of the top. The issue was the same as stated for "VF Bottom".
