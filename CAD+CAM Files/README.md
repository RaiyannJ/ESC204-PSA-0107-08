V1 - The very first design concept of the box. The issue with this was that we needed the top to be shorter than the bottom which was not the case in this iteration.

V2 Bottom - This was the second interation of just the bottom.

V2 Top - This was the second iteration of the top.

VF Bottom -  This was the final iteration of the bottom. The issue with this was that the print time was too long, so we had to reduce the thicknesses of some of the walls.

VF Top - This was the final iteration of the top. The issue was the same as stated for "VF Bottom".

Receipt1 - The first MYFab DigiFab order. It got rejected as there was some confusion surrounding the specifics of the print, and as a result the estimated printing time was too long.

Receipt2 - The second MYFab DigiFab order. The bottom and top pieces were printed, however there was a mismatch in dimensions between the two resulting in the box not being able to close properly.

ReceiptF - The final MYFab DigiFab order. Here only the top piece was ordered, since the bottom peice was able to properly fit the circuit within.
