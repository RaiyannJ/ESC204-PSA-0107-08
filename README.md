# ESC204-PSA-0107-08

This GitHub repo is our Prototyping Skills Assignment (PSA) Design Dossier. This dossier consists of any relevant files/resources relevant to our PSA.

Our design is a 3D-printed compartment that holds the prototype of our electrical system to light a greenhouse. In the "Final Integration + Showcase" folder will be a video showcasing our prototype as well as the functionality.

The layout of this dossier will follow this organized layout:
- There are different folders covering different key aspects of our design, from "CircuitPy Files" to "CAD Drawings/Files" etc.
- Each folder will have its' own README file, which briefly describes each file in the respective folder for your clarity
- One folder, named "Process Work", will contain files that do not fall into any major topics, but will consist of things such as Component Testing Evidence, any relevant calculations, rough sketches etc.
- Each of these folders (except Process Work and Final Integration) will have different versions of important files and will be titled "VNumber - Date" which indicates the version number and the date the file was created/updated. For example, the "CircuitPy Files" folder has 4 different files, V1 - V4, with respective dates. These files are different design choices acting as evidence for our design process
- These folders will have a file titled "Vfinal - Date". This is the final version of the code/circuit/drawing etc. that was used for our final prototype and the integration/showcase.
- The final folder, called "Final Integration + Showcase" demonstrates the full prototype and its functionality.
