# ESC204-PSA-0107-08

This GitHub repo is our Prototyping Skills Assignment (PSA) Design Dossier. This dossier consists of any relevant files/resources relevant to our PSA.

Our design is a 3D-printed compartment that holds the prototype of our electrical system to light a greenhouse. In the "Final Integration + Showcase" folder will be a video showcasing our prototype as well as the functionality.

The layout of this dossier will follow this organized layout:
- There are different folders covering different key aspects of our design, from "CircuitPy Files" to "CAD Drawings/Files" etc.
- Each folder will have its' own README file, which briefly describes each file in the respective folder for your clarity
- One folder, named "Process Work", will contain files that do not fall into any major topics, but will consist of things such as Component Testing Evidence, any relevant calculations, etc.
- Each of these folders will have different versions of important files and will be titled "VNumber - Date" which indicates the version number and the date the file was created/updated. For example, the "CircuitPy Files" folder has 5 different files, V1 - V4, with respective dates. These files are different design choices acting as evidence for our design process
- Each folder will have a file titled "Vfinal - Date". This is the final version of the code/circuit/drawing etc. that was used for our final prototype and the integration/showcase.
