5 Different versions of our CircuitPy code

V1 - figuring out the functionality of 1 button toggling 2 LEDS connected to 2 different ports
V2 - a version of the program where 3 LEDS are connected to 3 different ports
V3 - to minimize port usage, this version has 2 LEDS connected in parallel to one port and the 3rd LED connected to another port. In total, 2 ports are used
V4 - A modification of V3 to better space out our actual physical circuit
VFinal - final version (V4) but fully commented, spaced out, clean code!
