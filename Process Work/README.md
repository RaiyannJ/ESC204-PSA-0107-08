2LED_Toggle - Video of us testing a 2 LED toggle functionality

3LED_Test - Video of an earlier circuit, demonstrating the functionality required for this prototype

BlueLED_Calcs - calculations regarding forward voltage and resistance required for the blue LED

BlueLED_Testing - evidence of us properly testing the forward voltage of blue LED with the smallest resistance

PrintA - First 3D print submission. This is a photo of the top only, which was much smaller than intended (failed print)

PrintB - Second 3D print. Issue was that there was a slight printing mishap (not sure where)
