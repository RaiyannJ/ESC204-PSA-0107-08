6 different variations of our electrical circuit

V1 - A circuit with only 2 LEDS, but the toggling functionality was working
V2 - 3 LEDS, all connected to 3 different GPIO ports
V3 - 2 LEDS connected in parallel to one port, the 3rd LED in a separate port (2 total GPIO ports)
V4 - similar circuit, but more spaced out on the breadboard
V5 - the circuit we decided to choose and model our final CAD around, wires are stripped and the circuit is very clean
VFinal - Circuit in our showcase, only difference from V5 is that resistors were trimmed
