6 different variations of our electrical circuit

V1 - A circuit with only 2 LEDS, but the toggling functionality was working

V2 - 3 LEDS, all connected to 3 different GPIO ports (mapped as output) and a button connected to a 4th GPIO (input)

V3 - 2 LEDS connected in parallel to one port, the 3rd LED in a separate port (2 total GPIO ports now for LEDS)

V4 - similar circuit, but more spaced out on the breadboard

V5 - the circuit we decided to choose and model our final CAD around. Wires are stripped/color coded and the circuit is very clean

VFinal - Circuit in our showcase, only difference from V5 is that resistors were trimmed
