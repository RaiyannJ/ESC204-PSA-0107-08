V1 - A simple circuit diagram for one LED (from lab time)

V2 - Diagram of 2 LEDS and the button. NOTE: The button diagram will not change, it will be the same for any iteration

V3 - Diagram of 3 LEDS to 3 different ports

V4 - Some process work, but a version of the diagram with only 3 resistors and only 2 ports. In this diagram, the Blue and Red are in parallel to the port.

VFinal - This is a diagram where we use 4 resistors, where we have 2 in parallel (resistance division). This is our final diagram.
